## General Guidelines

### 1. Folder Naming

- Use clear, descriptive names for microservice directories.
- Follow a consistent naming convention such as `snake_case`.

### 2. Documentation

- Each microservice should have its own `README.md` file.
- Include the following in the microservice's README:
  - **Service Overview**: Brief description of the service.
  - **API Endpoints**: List of available endpoints with request/response formats.
  - **Setup Instructions**: Steps to install and run the service.
  - **Environment Variables**: Document required variables and default values.

### 3. Coding Standards

- Follow best practices for the programming language used.
- Use consistent coding styles enforced by linters and formatters.
  - Example: Pylint for Python, ESLint for JavaScript.

### 4. Testing

- Ensure a high level of test coverage for each microservice.
- Place all test files in a `/tests` directory.
- Include unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, where applicable.

### 5. Version Control

- Use a feature branch workflow:
  - `main` for production-ready code.
  - `dev` for integration of features.
  - Feature branches for specific tasks (e.g., `feature/add-auth`).
- Follow a consistent commit message format:
  - `[type] Description`
    - **Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`.

### 6. Dependencies

- Clearly define all dependencies in the respective configuration file:
  - Example: `requirements.txt` for Python ,`package.json` for Node.js.
- Use version locking to avoid compatibility issues (e.g., `npm ci`, `pip freeze`).

### 7. Environment Variables

- Use a `.env` file to manage sensitive configurations.
- Provide a `.env.example` file to document required variables.

### 8. Dockerization

- Each microservice should have a `Dockerfile` for containerization.
- Use `docker-compose` to manage multi-service setups.

### 9. API Documentation

- Document APIs using tools like Swagger, Redocly, Postman, or plain Markdown.
- Include details like:
  - Endpoint URLs
  - HTTP methods
  - Request parameters and bodies
  - Response structures and status codes

### 10. Logging and Monitoring

- Implement consistent logging across microservices.
- Use structured logs with a standard format (e.g., JSON).
- Integrate monitoring tools for health checks and performance metrics.

### 11. Security Practices

- Sanitize and validate all user inputs.
- Secure sensitive data with encryption.
- Regularly update dependencies to patch vulnerabilities.

### 12. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

- Set up pipelines for automated builds, testing, and deployments.
- Use tools like GitHub Actions and Ansible.

### 13. Code Reviews

- Require code reviews before merging into `main` or `dev`.

### 14. Error Handling

- Use consistent error handling across services.
- Return meaningful error messages with proper status codes (e.g., `400` for bad requests, `500` for server errors).

### 15. Scalability and Modularity

- Design each service to be modular and independently scalable.
- Avoid tight coupling between microservices.
