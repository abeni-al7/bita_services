## General Guidelines

### 1. Folder Naming

- Use clear, descriptive names for microservice directories.
- Follow a consistent naming convention such as `snake_case`.

### 2. Documentation

- Each microservice should have its own `README.md` file.
- Include the following in the microservice's README:
  - **Service Overview**: Brief description of the service.
  - **API Endpoints**: List of available endpoints with request/response formats.
  - **Setup Instructions**: Steps to install and run the service.
  - **Environment Variables**: Document required variables and default values.

### 3. Coding Standards

- Follow best practices for the programming language used.
- Use consistent coding styles enforced by linters and formatters.
  - Example: Pylint for Python, ESLint for JavaScript.

### 4. Testing

- Ensure a high level of test coverage for each microservice.
- Place all test files in a `/tests` directory.
- Include unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, where applicable.

### 5. Version Control

- Use a feature branch workflow:
  - `main` for production-ready code.
  - `dev` for integration of features.
  - Feature branches for specific tasks (e.g., `feature/add-auth`).
- Follow a consistent commit message format:
  - `[type] Description`
    - **Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`.

### 6. Dependencies

- Clearly define all dependencies in the respective configuration file:
  - Example: `requirements.txt` for Python ,`package.json` for Node.js.
- Use version locking to avoid compatibility issues (e.g., `npm ci`, `pip freeze`).

### 7. Environment Variables

- Use a `.env` file to manage sensitive configurations.
- Provide a `.env.example` file to document required variables.

### 8. Dockerization

- Each microservice should have a `Dockerfile` for containerization.
- Use `docker-compose` to manage multi-service setups.

### 9. API Documentation

- Document APIs using tools like Swagger, Redocly, Postman, or plain Markdown.
- Include details like:
  - Endpoint URLs
  - HTTP methods
  - Request parameters and bodies
  - Response structures and status codes

### 10. Logging and Monitoring

- Implement consistent logging across microservices.
- Use structured logs with a standard format (e.g., JSON).
- Integrate monitoring tools for health checks and performance metrics.

### 11. Security Practices

- Sanitize and validate all user inputs.
- Secure sensitive data with encryption.
- Regularly update dependencies to patch vulnerabilities.

### 12. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

- Set up pipelines for automated builds, testing, and deployments.
- Use tools like GitHub Actions and Ansible.

### 13. Code Reviews

- Require code reviews before merging into `main` or `dev`.

### 14. Error Handling

- Use consistent error handling across services.
- Return meaningful error messages with proper status codes (e.g., `400` for bad requests, `500` for server errors).

### 15. Scalability and Modularity

- Design each service to be modular and independently scalable.
- Avoid tight coupling between microservices.

### API Best Practices

### 1. Use RESTful Principles

- Design your API around **resources** (entities or objects), and use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on them.
- Ensure your API endpoints represent nouns, not actions.
  - **Correct**: `/users`, `/products`, `/orders`
  - **Incorrect**: `/getUser`, `/createOrder`

### 2. Version Your API

- **Versioning** is crucial to support backward compatibility as your API evolves.
- Use **URL Path Versioning** (e.g., `/v1/products`, `/v2/products`),
- Follow **Semantic Versioning** (`major.minor.patch`) to indicate changes (e.g., `v1.2.3`).

### 3. Use Meaningful and Consistent Naming

- Ensure endpoint names are **plural** to represent collections (e.g., `/users`, `/products`).
- Use **camelCase** or **snake_case** for naming query parameters and request bodies consistently.
- Avoid using **verbs** in the endpoint paths, as HTTP methods already convey the action.
  - **Correct**: `/users/{id}`, `/orders/{orderId}`
  - **Incorrect**: `/getUser/{id}`, `/createOrder`

### 4. HTTP Status Codes

- Use the correct HTTP status codes to indicate the result of the request:
  - **200 OK**: The request was successful (GET, PUT, PATCH).
  - **201 Created**: Resource was successfully created (POST).
  - **400 Bad Request**: Invalid request format or missing parameters.
  - **401 Unauthorized**: User is not authenticated.
  - **403 Forbidden**: User is authenticated but not authorized.
  - **404 Not Found**: Resource not found.
  - **500 Internal Server Error**: An error occurred on the server.

### 5. Use Consistent Data Formats

- Prefer **JSON** for data interchange. Avoid using XML unless necessary.
- Stick to a consistent data format for all responses and requests.
  - **Correct**: `application/json`
  - **Incorrect**: Mixing `application/json` and `text/xml` in different endpoints.

### 6. Security

- Always use **HTTPS** to encrypt traffic and protect sensitive data.
- Implement **authentication** (e.g., OAuth2, JWT) to ensure only authorized users can access your API.
- Use **rate limiting** to prevent abuse and ensure the API is available for all users.
- Sanitize inputs to prevent **SQL Injection**, **XSS**, and **other attacks**.

### 7. Error Handling and Messages

- Provide **clear error messages** with meaningful HTTP status codes.
- Include an error **code**, **message**, and **details** when returning errors to help users understand what went wrong.
  - Example:
    ```json
    {
      "error": {
        "code": "INVALID_USER_ID",
        "message": "The provided user ID is invalid.",
        "details": "The user ID must be a positive integer."
      }
    }
    ```
- Avoid exposing sensitive server information in error messages.

### 8. Pagination and Filtering

- Use **pagination** for endpoints that return large lists of items to prevent overloading the server or client.
- Implement filtering, sorting, and searching capabilities for list endpoints.
  - Example: `/items?limit=20&page=2&sort=price&filter=category:electronics`

### 9. Use HTTP Headers Effectively

- Use headers for **metadata** (e.g., pagination details like `X-Total-Count`).
- **Authorization** should always be included in headers, typically using the `Authorization` header for JWT or API keys.

### 10. Rate Limiting

- Implement **rate limiting** to avoid abuse of your API and ensure fair access.
- Provide headers to indicate rate limits, e.g., `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`.

### 11. Request and Response Body Structure

- **Request**:
  - Use **JSON Schema** or **OpenAPI** specifications to validate incoming data.
  - Keep the request bodies **simple** and **flat**, avoid deeply nested structures.
- **Response**:
  - Keep responses consistent in structure across all endpoints.
  - Return only the necessary data and avoid sending redundant or unnecessary information.
  - Use **status** codes, **pagination metadata**, and **error messages** as needed.

### 12. Caching

- Use **caching** mechanisms to improve performance by reducing the need to recompute expensive requests.
- Use appropriate cache headers like `Cache-Control`, `ETag`, and `Last-Modified`.

### 13. Use HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State)

- If applicable, provide **hyperlinks** to related resources to improve discoverability.
- For example:
  ```json
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Product A",
    "links": [
      { "rel": "self", "href": "/products/1" },
      { "rel": "reviews", "href": "/products/1/reviews" }
    ]
  }
  ```
